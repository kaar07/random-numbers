   If we are choosing a million digits at random and if the first 999,999 of them are zero,
   the chances that the last digit is zero is still 1/10, in a truly random situation.  

   Von Neumann Suggestion: Square the number and take the middle digits.
   (Pseudorandom or Quasirandom sequences)
   Danger: Getting into cycle.
